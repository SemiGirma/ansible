## Purpose of the .yaml File

This .yaml file serves the purpose of deploying tasks through our Ansible server. It leverages Git to capture and manage changes made by team members. The collaborative effort involves addressing a bug related to variable changes, specifically:

```yaml
- semi2: 26
```

When executing the command, the intention is to work together to rectify this issue.
